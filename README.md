# Generative_AI_product_titles

This repo contains the code for my master thesis on SOTA generative language models for product title creation SO FAR. Specifically, I leverage new generative language models (especially LLaMa by Meta AI) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanisms to opimize product titles using AirBnB listings as an example. Subsequently, I deploy two sophisticated methods (multi-modal deep-learning based and RLHF-inspired) to judge the quality of the generated titles. 



The code is still messy and in jupyter notebook format as it was developed on Google Colab.
